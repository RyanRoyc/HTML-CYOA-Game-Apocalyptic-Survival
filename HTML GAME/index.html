        <h1>Apocalypse Survival</h1>
        <p>The world as you knew it has crumbled. Society has collapsed, and chaos reigns. Cities lie in ruins, and survivors scavenge for resources while facing threats from both the living and the dead. You find yourself alone in a desolate street, the remnants of civilization hauntingly silent around you.</p>
        <p>As you stand there, you spot a dilapidated building nearby, its windows shattered, and its walls bearing the scars of the apocalypse. You know you must seek shelter and gather supplies to survive. The building seems like your best bet for now.</p>
